It was only a matter of time before the national debate over fetal rights and abortion would lead to this: A woman in Alabama has been charged with manslaughter for allegedly being involved in an argument in December that ended when another woman shot her in the stomach. The victim was five months pregnant and lost her baby. The shooter has walked free.The charges, filed last week, focus new scrutiny on Alabama over a new law that treats doctors who perform abortions as Class A felons subject to potential life imprisonment. The law bans abortions at any stage of pregnancy. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a law in May criminalizing abortions beyond eight weeks of pregnancy, with doctors subject to between five and 15 years of imprisonment.
Although women who seek abortions aren’t subject to prosecution under the new Alabama law, existing law defines “an unborn child in utero at any stage of development, regardless of viability as a person and human being for purposes of the state laws dealing with murder, manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and assault.”
Against that backdrop, some zealous prosecutors and law enforcers undoubtedly feel they have a green light to determine motive and culpability when a pregnant woman is involved in situations that endanger the life of her fetus. Women are at increasing risk of becoming legally defined as mere reproductive vessels, with their own rights becoming subservient to those of the unborn.


Details of the Alabama case are not entirely clear. Marshae Jones, 27, of Birmingham, was five months pregnant when she got into an argument with Ebony Jemison, 23, regarding the unborn baby’s father. Jemison told BuzzFeed News that she tried to get away when the argument became too heated, but Jones allegedly persisted. Jemison got into her own car, grabbed a gun and shot Jones in the stomach.“The investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby,” the website AL.com quoted Pleasant Grove, Ala., police Lt. Danny Reid as saying in December. He added ominously: “It was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight, which resulted in the death of her own unborn baby.”

Jemison was originally charged with manslaughter in December, but a grand jury declined to indict her. The grand jury later indicted Jones.It’s a patently ludicrous case. Prosecutors effectively must argue in court that Jemison had no other choice than to shoot Jones, though no life-threatening conditions appeared to exist. Far more difficult will be proving that Jones knew she would be shot if she persisted in confronting Jemison.

The case opens vast new avenues for prosecutors to go after pregnant women who smoke, drink, jaywalk, jog or even travel in a car that later is involved in an accident. This is exactly where “pro-life” zealotry is leading.

JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission on Friday issued an order allowing Planned Parenthood to continue performing abortions at its Reproductive Health Services clinic in St. Louis for the foreseeable future.Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi granted Planned Parenthood’s motion for a stay, which will allow abortions to continue at least until he hears the case later this year. The next administrative hearing is scheduled for Aug. 1.Planned Parenthood “has an active license that shall remain in effect for the pendency of RHS’ (Reproductive Health Services’) case at the Commission,” he wrote.
The order represents a victory for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, which is seeking to continue abortion services in St. Louis despite action from the state Department of Health and Senior Services, or DHSS. The state is seeking to stop abortions there over concerns about patient safety.
“We are relieved to have this last-minute reprieve, which means patients can continue accessing safe, legal abortion at Planned Parenthood in St. Louis for the time being,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, a clinic obstetrician/gynecologist, said in a statement. “This has been a week-to-week fight for our patients and every Missourian who needs access to abortion care.”

On June 21, the DHSS denied Planned Parenthood’s application to continue abortion services at its clinic on Forest Park Avenue, citing a series of deficiencies there.But, the clinic was allowed to continue abortion services through Friday because of an order issued last week by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer. In his order, Stelzer said the state Administrative Hearing Commission, or AHC, which handles bureaucratic disputes, should review the case.Dr. Randall Williams, DHSS director, on Friday referred questions about the case to the attorney general’s office.

“We’re currently reviewing the AHC’s decision closely to determine next steps,” said Chris Nuelle, spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican.McNicholas said the biggest effects from Friday’s decision will be on the St. Louis clinic’s patients. During weeks of legal uncertainty, staff employees had to call women each day to tell them whether their appointments would stand.McNicholas was in the St. Louis clinic Friday when news of the decision was announced to clinic staff.“There were cheers and even some tears,” she said, adding that the decision is “a brief moment of celebration, but now back to work both for our patients and the larger cause.”


In a filing earlier this week, Planned Parenthood attorneys argued the hearing commission should order the state to renew the clinic’s license.“Petitioner affirmatively states that its renewal application was complete and that all of the applicable requirements for licensure have been met,” attorney Charles W. Hatfield wrote in a complaint filed Monday night. “Nothing in Missouri’s statutory or regulatory scheme provides any basis or justification for Respondent’s asserted grounds for license denial.”
The state filed a brief in response denying the clinic’s claim that its action to deny the license was “arbitrary and capricious.”
In denying Planned Parenthood’s license, Missouri cited inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The attorney general’s office argued the license denial was justified in part because Planned Parenthood had not made available five physicians whom the state wanted to interview concerning patients who had suffered complications.“It is not arbitrary or capricious for the Department to request interviews with treating physicians in an investigation,” the state said in response to Planned Parenthood’s motion. “And it is not arbitrary or capricious for the Department to infer from the noncooperation of RHS and its physicians that they lack satisfactory explanations for their conduct,” the state said.


Dandamudi, ruling on behalf of the entire four-member commission, wrote that the DHSS’ argument that it had to deny the license because it could not interview the physicians was “unpersuasive.”
Because of Missouri law, according to DHSS, “it must deny RHS’ application because it cannot determine RHS complied with applicable statutes and regulations without the interviews it seeks. At this point, we find DHSS’ position unpersuasive,” the commission said.“Our review of the applicable statutes and rules finds no provision that affirmatively provides an obligation for DHSS to make, or RHS to procure, such interviews,” the commission said.
The commission said the DHSS had cited other reasons for denying Planned Parenthood’s license, but that the crux of the health department’s justification in denying the license relied on the lack of physician interviews.“The absence of these interviews in itself does not constitute a failure to comply with licensure requirements,” the commission said.If the state ultimately succeeds in ending abortion services at the St. Louis clinic, Missouri would be the first state since the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide, to not have at least one abortion clinic.



Reproductive Health Services is the only clinic providing abortion services in operation in Missouri.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, last month signed a strict anti-abortion law that will ban the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. The law takes effect Aug. 28.Erin Heffernan of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

ST. LOUIS — U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-University City, announced a federal bill Friday that would allow local governments, including St. Louis, to pass stricter gun laws without approval from a state legislature.Clay announced the effort at St. Louis Children’s Hospital, which treats more gunshot wounds than almost any children’s hospital in the country. He was joined by St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, city Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards and local hospital and nonprofit leaders.
The bill is the latest effort to address gun violence, what the mayor calls one of the city’s most critical issues, and comes after several unusually violent weeks in St. Louis that saw five children or teens killed by gunshot wounds in the city this June.
Clay’s bill — H.R. 3435, the Local Public Health and Safety Protection Act — attempts to address the problem by forcing states to allow local governments to pass their own gun laws, even if they are stricter than state laws. Any state that receives federal public safety funding would need to comply.

“I’m tired of the violence,” Clay said at the Friday press conference. “I’m tired of the excuses. And I’m tired of our state Legislature being unable or just too frightened to do something about gun violence.”
Cities in 43 states, including Missouri, are prohibited from enacting their own gun laws by state statute today, Clay said. He argued the legislation is needed in cities like St. Louis, which has for years been ranked among the most violent cities in America.“Unless we get control of the flow of unrestricted guns into our community, we are not going to solve this problem,” he said.The legislation has 20 co-sponsors in the U.S. House, but faces dim prospects of becoming federal law any time soon. It would need approval from the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate that, according to Clay, is “captive” to gun rights advocates at the National Rifle Association.

Krewson said if the city got the power to write its own gun laws, her top priority would be to require a permit to carry a gun, reversing a vote by the Missouri Legislature to abolish the state’s concealed carry permits in 2016.“This has become so much more of a crisis in the last few years because Missouri no longer requires gun owners to carry a permit,” Krewson said after the news conference Friday. “So that’s the first step. So then if a law enforcement officer stops you with a gun they can ask, ‘Let me see your permit.’”


Edwards, the public safety director, said Friday that without local control over gun laws, the city’s police department has taken other routes to controlling the use of guns including referring more weapons cases to federal agencies and taking guns from minors through child safety laws.
Gov. Mike Parson’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the legislation Friday. Statewide gun rights advocates at the Missouri Firearms Coalition argue the bill would overly restrict gun rights while doing little to curb the city’s violence.
“There have been so many bills hyped as a magical cure to gun violence,” said Aaron Dorr, policy adviser for the Missouri Firearms Coalition. “And instead they are used to demonize and prosecute law-abiding gun owners and ignore the criminals that are actually committing the crimes.”Clay acknowledged Friday that city gun laws wouldn’t be a cure-all to the crime problem.“This is a sliver of what we need, but at least it gives us another tool,” he said.But hospital leaders at the press conference Friday supported the bill, arguing they see the effects of the city’s gun violence firsthand.


So far in 2019, more than 40 children have been treated at St. Louis Children’s Hospital with critical or fatal injuries from gunshot wounds, said the hospital’s chief medical officer, Alexis Elward.
Medical professionals at the hospital routinely operate on toddlers riddled with bullets and treat children shot while walking to the bus stop or playing in the front yard, Elward said.“But there is nothing routine or natural about it,” Elward said. She added: “For the healthcare professionals here this is not political. This is not just professional. It’s intensely personal.”Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri’s top health official, a licensed obstetrician/gynecologist, is the face of the state’s effort to end abortions at the only clinic in Missouri that performs them.Dr. Randall Williams, a holdover from former Gov. Eric Greitens’ administration, is the expert Gov. Mike Parson leans on to explain why officials believe Planned Parenthood should be barred from terminating pregnancies at its Central West End clinic.The abortion issue has put Williams, director of the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services, front and center in a debate that coincides with Parson, a Republican, signing legislation last month that will prohibit women from terminating their pregnancies after eight weeks, except in medical emergencies.
Williams anticipated criticism when he took the job as state health director in 2017, he said in response to written questions from the Post-Dispatch.“Our job is to ensure the nearly 4,000 licensed health facilities are complying with current Missouri laws and regulations,” Williams said. “As for feedback, both positive and negative, I try to use it to help make us better at serving the people of Missouri.
“I also remember an old adage from my many years in court as an expert witness: If the facts are on your side, argue the facts; and if the facts are not on your side, impugn people’s motives. So I am discerning in interpreting some people’s motives when they provide feedback.”


Williams did not address his own views on abortion, saying only, “Abortion is legal in Missouri, and I want it to be safe.”He wasn’t always a bureaucrat. From 1989 until 2015 he was an obstetrician in private practice in Raleigh, North Carolina. In that role, he says, he delivered more than 2,000 babies.In 2011, Williams was a candidate for mayor of Raleigh, but came in last in the three-way, nonpartisan race. News reports at the time said Williams was a Republican who had supported President Barack Obama.After Patrick McCrory was elected governor of North Carolina in 2013, Williams served on his transition team for health care issues. In 2015, he was named health director in North Carolina.

After two sometimes turbulent years, Williams came to Missouri in 2017 as Greitens assembled his cabinet.Since his arrival, Williams has been among the most high-profile agency directors, primarily because he has generated controversy as the head of a department that licenses health care facilities, tracks the spread of disease and is setting up the state’s medical marijuana program.

With the clamor over the new abortion law still reverberating, a St. Louis judge issued an order this month allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open amid a battle over the facility’s license.

That order expires on Friday, but meanwhile, Planned Parenthood has appealed the license denial to the state’s Administrative Hearing Commission, where the judge said the matter belonged.
Planned Parenthood has asked the commission to allow it to continue abortions until at least Aug. 1, when the state and the clinic are scheduled to meet for a hearing.
The dispute centers around the results of a two-month state investigation into Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic. The state has outlined 30 deficiencies at the clinic, and it says the clinic has addressed a handful to the state’s satisfaction.The deficiencies cited included inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The state said some problems noted in the investigation caused “serious patient harm.”
In response, Planned Parenthood officials accused Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.Williams says politics have nothing to do with his department’s decision to revoke the license of the St. Louis clinic.“There is no influence that is exerted or accepted in those areas, whether it be from the governor or the Legislature,” he said.


He also denied trying to discourage medication abortions by requiring pelvic exams before prescribing the pills. Planned Parenthood argues the exams are medically unnecessary in most cases, but Williams has said they are standard medical practice.
Missouri residentWillams, 62, often wears a bow tie and likes to talk about running. According to his biography, he has run marathons in Boston, New York, Paris and Jerusalem, among other locations.He has kept a home in North Carolina, where his wife, Elizabeth Williams, still lives and works. In Jefferson City, he lives in an apartment near the Capitol. He said he votes and pays taxes in Missouri.Early in the morning, he often takes his dog Mo and sets off across the Missouri River bridge for a run. He says the Katy Trail is among his favorite places in Missouri.“I love my run in the morning,” Williams said.
But his time in the capital city hasn’t always been tranquil.
Williams has sparred with lawmakers on a number of occasions, including in July 2018 when House budget writers scolded him for bungling a program that helps get stroke and heart attack patients to the most appropriate facility in the shortest amount of time.The dust-up came after Parson vetoed $153,000 from the program, setting off alarm bells that the program might be discontinued.

Williams said the veto was a way to force hospitals to pay more to fund the program. He and Parson attempted to play down potential problems, arguing that their maneuver would not result in a break in service.
Lawmakers said they were misled about the intent of the veto.Williams also was targeted by the House budget panel after he refused to release information about an outbreak of the tick-borne Bourbon virus.
In blocking the release of information, Williams cited confidentiality laws. Lawmakers responded by cutting eight positions in his agency’s budget.Williams has been accused of being too secretive on other issues, as well.This year, Cole County Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce said the health department must release the results of lab tests related to 2017 protests in downtown St. Louis.
The judge wrote that Williams’ agency violated open records laws when it refused to release lab tests of a liquid that St. Louis County police said was thrown at officers during protests, which were sparked by the acquittal of former police Officer Jason Stockley on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith.

The judge ordered the state to pay the ACLU of Missouri, which sought the records, $10,754 in fines and legal fees.

The liquid was identified by police as apple cider vinegar.Joyce’s ruling came two days after the Post-Dispatch filed a lawsuit against the agency for refusing to release records showing who is seeking to sell and grow medical marijuana in Missouri.The department says the constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana forbids the release of the records.Circuit Judge Daniel R. Green ruled in the Post-Dispatch’s favor last week.
The department also eliminated geographic details from its reporting of West Nile virus cases, citing privacy concerns.“One of our agency’s top priorities is to follow the law and provide transparency and access to public information while using an abundance of caution to follow the law and protect confidential information,” Williams said.


N.C. controversyThe controversies Williams has faced in Missouri were foreshadowed during his tenure in North Carolina.In 2016, the state’s toxicologist testified in a lawsuit that Williams and other environmental officials attempted to “play down the risk” of coal ash contamination of drinking wells by rescinding a do-not-drink notice.
The toxicologist said in a deposition that the state was telling people the water was safe when it knew it wasn’t.Williams said he rescinded the warning notices because they were stirring up unwarranted fears.“And that there was a concern that we had alarmed people disproportionate to the risk,” he said in a deposition.The dispute led to the resignation of at least one state health official, who said she couldn’t support how Williams had downplayed the risks.Williams’ actions became an issue when he was being confirmed in the Missouri Senate.
“After Flint, Michigan,” said Senate Majority Leader Gina Walsh, “I just want to make sure things like that don’t happen in my state,” referring to Flint’s problems with lead in its water supply. “Is it not your job to enforce your own rules?”
Williams ultimately was confirmed unanimously by the Senate.

When asked this week if he planned to continue on in Missouri, Williams said he would.“I love Missouri, my colleagues, and the opportunity to help people and serve our great state.”

JEFFERSON CITY — Auditor Nicole Galloway on Thursday issued an open letter to Gov. Mike Parson pressuring the governor to address the influence of so-called dark money in state government.Galloway, a Democrat who is preparing to launch a campaign for governor, said Parson, a Republican, could take executive actions that would address the perception of pay-to-play politics by groups that do not have to reveal the sources of their donations.The letter was the latest effort by Galloway to differentiate herself from Parson, whom she would likely face in next year’s gubernatorial election if both decide to run as expected. Parson’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
“You could issue an executive order immediately to ensure transparency when it comes to the role of dark money in securing government contracts,” Galloway said, adding that she had proposed legislation that would act as a framework for such an executive order.
Her legislation, she said, would require people or businesses entering into a state contract for $5,000 or more to disclose payments over $500 annually to 501(c)(4) nonprofits, which do not have to reveal donors.

Galloway, 37, was appointed state auditor in 2015 and narrowly won a four-year term last November. That means she could run against Parson, 63, next year without sacrificing her statewide office if she lost.
Her letter comes a year after she sent a similar letter to Parson, days after former Gov. Eric Greitens left office and Parson was sworn in. Greitens’ 501(c)(4) nonprofit, A New Missouri, raised $6.1 million in contributions in 2017, and the identities of the vast majority of the nonprofit’s donors remain secret.In her 2019 letter, Galloway cited Kingdom Principles, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that tried to alter how colleges and universities handle sexual assault claims, as a reason Parson should address dark money.“Media reports uncovered a trail of correspondence strategizing about this matter between lawmakers and a lobbyist who formed the dark money group behind the legislation,” Galloway said.

She also suggested a measure pending on Parson’s desk would create “the conditions for public corruption” if signed into law by reducing the number of requests for proposals advertised by the state and ultimately making the bidding process less competitive.Among the provisions of House Bill 1088, nicknamed by proponents the “Million Dollar Boondoggle Act,” is one that she argued would make the “potential use” of shortlisting “discretionary to all state contracts.”

Shortlisting is a method used by state entities to limit the number of businesses eligible to compete in the bidding process.
In the 2018 letter, Galloway asked Parson to “resolve the specter of dark money and secret donors influencing government.”She said the Legislature should pass a law requiring 501(c)(4) nonprofits — such as A New Missouri — to disclose donors. Lawmakers did not approve that legislation during the last legislative session.
Parson’s allies have not launched a 501(c)(4) nonprofit of their own. Instead, the governor has raised money for his election through a political action committee that files paperwork with the Missouri Ethics Commission.Unlike a traditional campaign account, his Uniting Missouri PAC can accept unlimited donations. But unlike a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Parson must reveal the source of every donation.

JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway is planning to run for governor next year, the executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party told the Post-Dispatch.""She's very serious about the race and is taking steps to assemble a team and the resources it would take to win,"" said Lauren Gepford, executive director of the state Democrats, adding that she did not know when Galloway would make a formal announcement.Galloway, a Democrat, won a four-year term as auditor in November after being appointed to the post in 2015 by then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. She narrowly defeated Republican Saundra McDowell last year, winning 50.4% of the vote. 
Galloway's pending entrance into the race presents a dilemma for state Sen. Scott Sifton, D-south St. Louis County, who said earlier this year he intended to run for governor. He declined to comment for this article.
If both did run, the two would face off in an August 2020 primary, which Democratic insiders would like to avoid.

Sifton reported having $313,000 in his campaign coffers as of April 1. Galloway had $65,798 in her account after raising $114,194 in the first quarter.
Galloway, 37, of Columbia, would be the first woman elected governor in Missouri if she were to win in November 2020. She would have to defeat Gov. Mike Parson, 63, to win the office.Parson, a Republican, has more than $3 million in campaign funds spread across two separate accounts. Parson ascended to the state's top job one year ago after then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, resigned after months of scandal.Before Greitens' election in 2016, Democrats controlled most statewide offices in Jefferson City.But as of this year, Galloway was the only Democrat left holding statewide office in Missouri.
In the last several months, she has made moves to differentiate herself from Parson.
During her inaugural address in January, Galloway criticized the Parson administration's Department of Revenue for secrecy concerning a tax withholding error that sent jitters through state government. During the speech, Parson was sitting feet from Galloway's podium.

“The administration might have been trying to sweep this under the rug, but I will hold them accountable to you,” Galloway said in her address. “Missourians deserve transparency.”
In May, she needled Parson's office for citing the First Amendment to close public records, and asked a Parson ally, Attorney General Eric Schmitt, to issue an opinion on the legality of such a citation. Schmitt has yet to issue one.
She also criticized a new anti-abortion law Parson signed last month, which bans the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy. ""He wants a woman’s decisions over her health care to be criminalized,"" Galloway said. ""It’s extreme and cruel.""
Jean Evans, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, said it was no surprise Galloway was preparing a run for governor.""She's been attacking the governor for a while so we knew she was running,"" Evans said. ""It's not news. I mean, it is. But it's not to us.""President Donald Trump won Missouri in 2016 by 19 percentage points. That said, Missouri Democrats running for U.S. Senate and governor that year lost by more narrow margins.

Still, Evans predicted Parson, who was elected lieutenant governor in 2016, would win a full four-year term as governor. She cited economic growth and the governor's stable hand as reasons voters would give him another four years in office.

""It doesn't matter if it's Nicole, Scott Sifton, or anyone else ... I think the governor matches what people want in Missouri,"" she said.

JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a warrant of execution for Russell Bucklew, who was convicted of killing a southeast Missouri man in 1996 during a crime rampage.The state’s high court set Bucklew’s execution date for Oct. 1.The warrant comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in April ruled against Bucklew’s bid to halt his death by lethal injection. Attorneys for Bucklew, now 51, argued his medical condition would lead to extreme suffering when put to death by lethal injection.Bucklew’s medical condition, cavernous hemangioma, causes weakened and malformed blood vessels, and tumors in his nose and throat could rupture and bleed.
“The Eighth Amendment has never been understood to guarantee a condemned inmate a painless death,” Justice Neil Gorsuch said in April. “That’s a luxury not guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.”
Bucklew’s execution has been delayed numerous times in the 22 years since he was convicted of first-degree murder.


In 1997, a Boone County jury recommended the death penalty for Bucklew after convicting him of killing Michael Sanders, 27, the boyfriend of Bucklew’s ex-girlfriend.

JEFFERSON CITY — Attorneys for Missouri’s only abortion clinic have asked a state panel to reverse a decision by regulators that would stop legal abortions in the state.On Friday, the state Department of Health and Senior Services denied Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region’s application to continue abortion services at its Central West End clinic, citing a series of deficiencies there.The clinic is allowed to continue abortion services through Friday because of an order by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer. In his order, Stelzer said the state Administrative Hearing Commission, which handles bureaucratic disputes, should review the case.
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood have asked the commission to conduct a hearing on the dispute. They asked the commission to force the state to re-license the clinic.
“Petitioner affirmatively states that its renewal application was complete and that all of the applicable requirements for licensure have been met,” attorney Charles W. Hatfield wrote in a complaint filed Monday night. “Nothing in Missouri’s statutory or regulatory scheme provides any basis or justification for Respondent’s asserted grounds for license denial.”

The case has been assigned to Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi, and the commission has set a hearing for Aug. 1 in St. Louis.
Because Planned Parenthood is only authorized to perform abortions through Friday, its attorneys asked Dandamudi for an order allowing it to continue providing abortions until the commission reviews the case.He is one of three judges on the Administrative Hearing Commission and was appointed by then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, in 2010.Dandamudi has also served as an assistant attorney general for Missouri and has worked as general counsel for the state Board of Registration for the Healing Arts.
The fight before the Administrative Hearing Commission is the latest development in a licensing dispute that has drawn national attention.
If Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic is forced to stop providing abortions, Missouri would be the first state since 1974 to have no abortion clinic in operation.Beyond the licensing dispute, Missouri lawmakers this year approved a sweeping anti-abortion proposal that bans the procedure, in most cases, at eight weeks of pregnancy.

Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed the measure last month. Most of its provisions take effect in August.

Missouri appears to be working hard to maintain its NAACP designation as a state perhaps best avoided. The state attorney general’s office this month released its assessment of 2018 traffic stops by local police, and the results are dismal: Black drivers are on average 91 percent more likely than white motorists to be pulled over.Attorney General Eric Schmitt made no attempt to sugarcoat the statistics, which local law enforcement agencies are required to report. The racial breakdown of drivers involved in traffic stops helps authorities keep tabs on police jurisdictions where bias might play a role in law enforcement decisions.
An elevated number of traffic stops doesn’t always signify racial bias. For example, cities with overwhelmingly dominant black populations in theory should have a number of traffic stops skewed toward blacks. The same should hold true of white drivers in heavily white-dominated cities.But that’s not how the numbers worked out. Particularly in the St. Louis area, blacks are being stopped far out of proportion to their representation in the population. In St. Louis city, blacks were subjected to traffic stops at a rate six times higher than their representation in the population and were 16.5 times more likely to be stopped than whites. That’s bad news for a city already immersed in controversy over reports of overt racism within police ranks.



In Bellefontaine Neighbors, blacks were stopped nearly 8.6 times more than their numbers are represented in the population. Whites were stopped less than one-tenth of their ratio in the population.Statewide, there were a total of 1.54 million traffic stops, with most — 1.18 million or 76.5% — involving white drivers. The statewide driving population is 82.8% white. Blacks represent only 10.9% of the driving population but represented 19.2% of traffic stops.Roughly 6.6% of cars and/or drivers were searched. Blacks and Hispanics statewide were subjected to far higher rates of search. Interestingly, however, blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to have possessed illegal items than whites, the report says.
Although the details in Schmitt’s report were exhaustive, there is still room for improvement. Including the time of day when a stop was made, for example, has helped other states identify specific police departments suspected of persistent racial harassment. That’s based on statistics indicating that traffic stops involving blacks are demonstrably higher during daylight hours, when officers can see the race of the driver, versus nighttime when lighting makes racial distinctions more difficult to detect.
The NAACP issued a travel advisory on Missouri in 2017, citing in part the high disparity in traffic stops between blacks and white. Since then, the disparities have worsened. If Gov. Mike Parson truly cares about the state’s reputation and its ability to attract new business, he should make reversing these numbers a top priority.

JEFFERSON CITY — A nonprofit formed to boost former Gov. Eric Greitens took $50,000 from an organization affiliated with Charles Koch, a Kansas businessman and GOP mega-donor.Tax filings made by The Seminar Network Chamber of Commerce Inc. show the group donated the money in 2017 to A New Missouri, the “dark-money” outfit formed by allies of Greitens early that year to promote Greitens’ conservative agenda and personal brand.A New Missouri raised $6.1 million in 2017, but the sources of the vast majority of that war chest remain shrouded in secrecy because the 501(c)(4) nonprofit does not have to reveal its donors.
Because of tax filings made by The Seminar Network and one other organization, some information about A New Missouri’s fundraising has been made public.
The Center for Responsive Politics revealed in May that A New Missouri also accepted $500,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, an organization that promotes conservative judges.The Seminar Network’s donation to A New Missouri represented a small portion of the network’s overall activities in 2017, the filing shows.

According to its tax filing, The Seminar Network also gave $47.5 million to Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) group that supports Republicans and which doesn’t have to reveal its donors.
The Seminar Network Chamber of Commerce said in its tax filing that it was formed to “advance its members’ common business interests by advancing the principles of free markets and a free society.”Mark Holden is listed as The Seminar Network’s president. He is also the senior vice president of Koch Industries Inc. and is chairman of Americans for Prosperity Foundation, according to its website.
A New Missouri filed its own tax return — known as a Form 990 — late last year, several months after Greitens, a Republican, resigned following months of scandal.
A New Missouri’s filing confirmed the organization received enough money in 2017 to rival the campaign accounts of statewide candidates. It shows that money flowed to political consulting firms tied to Greitens and his campaign — reinforcing concern over close ties between Greitens’ campaign and the nonprofit.Unlike a traditional state campaign committee, A New Missouri was able to accept unlimited campaign donations and was able to shield its donors.

In July, at the culmination of a monthslong Missouri House investigation into Greitens’ campaign apparatus, then-state Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, wrote in a complaint to the Missouri Ethics Commission that A New Missouri was formed to evade state campaign contribution limits and donor disclosure requirements.

Indeed, the 67 donations recorded in the 990 filing all exceed $2,600 — the cap voters in 2016 placed on individual donations to candidates.The ethics complaint is still pending, and the ethics committee’s proceedings are private, meaning little is known about how the agency is handling Barnes’ complaint.Greitens’ successor, Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has avoided raising so-called “dark money.” Instead, his allies have used the Uniting Missouri PAC to raise money for Parson’s election in 2020.While the political action committee does not have to adhere to donation limits set in 2016, it does have to disclose its donors under Missouri law.

ST. LOUIS — A judge’s ruling Monday extended Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic license through Friday, allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic time to appeal to a state commission.


            Judge Michael Stelzer's ruling in Planned Parenthood v MissouriSt. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended his June 10 preliminary injunction through 5 p.m. Friday to give the clinic time to challenge the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services’ decision to deny its license to the Administrative Hearing Commission.“The Court has no authority to intercede in this matter until there has been a final decision by the AHC,” Stelzer’s ruling said.
Stelzer’s ruling also dismissed other counts in the lawsuit, removing the case from state courts and ordering that it be taken up with the AHC. The panel handles licensing disputes between state agencies, businesses and people.Earlier this month, Gov. Mike Parson appointed a former judge to the AHC who has supported an anti-abortion pregnancy center.
The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 reprimanded former Macon County Associate Circuit Judge Philip Prewitt for encouraging people to donate to local charities on Facebook, including Ray of Hope Pregnancy Care Ministries, an anti-abortion nonprofit.Prewitt said he would consider recusing himself if requested by a party in the case.


“I don’t see where it would be a conflict,” Prewitt said. “It doesn’t violate the judicial rules, so I don’t see how it would violate any commissioner rules either.”Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said the governor named Prewitt to the commission based on his experience as a judge and his past military service and that his stance on abortion was not a factor.The four commissioners work independently, and cases are assigned on a rotating basis.Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis clinic, said in a statement Monday that the “terrifying reality is that access is hanging on by a thread with a narrowing timeline. The truth is, if the Administrative Hearing Commission does not act by Friday, abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone. This creates uncertainty for the patients we serve.”

A health department spokeswoman declined to comment Monday.Planned Parenthood had not appealed to the AHC as of 5 p.m. Monday, records show.If the commission sides with the state, Missouri could become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.The state license only affects abortion services. The clinic also provides routine medical care to men and women, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease tests, permanent birth control procedures and counseling.

The state denied Planned Parenthood’s license last week, citing deficiencies from an investigation of the clinic this spring.

            DHSS license denial letter to Planned Parenthood


            DHSS 'Emergency Amendment' to licensing regulations


            DHSS notice of deficiencies in Planned Parenthood lawsuitIn denying Planned Parenthood’s license, Missouri cited inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.
The state investigation found four instances of incomplete surgical abortions, which may have been hindered by patients’ obesity or uterine malformations. One of the patients also experienced a failed medication abortion, according to the state’s report.Incomplete abortions are a rare complication occurring in fewer than 1% of all procedures.Planned Parenthood officials have accused Gov. Mike Parson’s administration of politicizing health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.
In a statement issued Friday, Parson said “Planned Parenthood is losing its license because it failed to meet basic standards of care.”Planned Parenthood sued the department last month claiming the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s annual license amid an investigation into the clinic. The state says Planned Parenthood has failed to comply with regulations by not compelling five doctors who have worked at the clinic to be interviewed.


In May, Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning the procedures after the eighth week of pregnancy. Most of the provisions in that law take effect Aug. 28.

ST. LOUIS — Planned Parenthood will continue providing abortions at least until a St. Louis judge issues a ruling in the clinic’s legal battle with the state Department of Health and Senior Services, which on Friday declined to renew the facility’s license.


            DHSS license denial letter to Planned ParenthoodCircuit Judge Michael Stelzer said in a brief court hearing Friday that despite the state’s decision, the abortion clinic’s license remains valid because of his June 10 preliminary injunction preserving the license. “Planned Parenthood’s doors remain open,” M’Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said after the hearing. “The judge left his injunction in place, which means that Missourians can continue to access the full range of reproductive health care in Missouri for now.”
The fate of the license now rests with Stelzer, who said he would issue a ruling soon.
If the state’s denial stands, Missouri would become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy. The denial means Planned Parenthood can appeal to a state licensing commission.

The state license only affects abortion services. The clinic also provides routine medical care to men and women, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease tests, permanent birth control procedures and counseling.Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, said at a news conference Friday in Gov. Mike Parson’s office that politics played no role in the state’s decision to deny the license and that the clinic had not corrected more than two dozen deficiencies state inspectors had identified earlier this year.

A key point of contention has been the state’s requirement of pelvic exams prior to an abortion. The clinic said a recent state requirement had compelled physicians to perform two pelvic exams before an abortion — one 72 hours prior, and the second the same day of the abortion.
The department, however, said pelvic exams must be completed 72 hours prior to an abortion because of the state’s informed consent law, which says doctors must identify risks to a patient three days before an abortion.On Friday, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said the St. Louis clinic a day earlier had stopped performing pelvic exams three days before an abortion, instead resuming its practice of doing exams on the same day of abortions.
Williams said his agency had issued a regulation that would allow Planned Parenthood to conduct pelvic exams when it sees fit.

“I am issuing an emergency rule today that Planned Parenthood can defer the pelvic exam until the day of the surgery if in their estimation — using their clinical judgment — that they think there’s a medical reason that they should do that,” Williams said. “We do not want patients having two pelvic exams.”

Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for DHSS, said the state had not required two pelvic exams prior to an abortion. She said the disagreement over the timing of the exam is what led to physicians performing two pelvic exams.

“We’ve never required two,” she said.Missouri health officials had asked Stelzer to reconsider his order allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open through Friday. Health officials also filed records of its two-month investigation into the clinic noting “at least 30 deficiencies” that the state says must be corrected before the clinic’s license can be renewed.


            DHSS notice of deficiencies in Planned Parenthood lawsuitDeficiencies the state cited last week included inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.


The state investigation found four instances of incomplete surgical abortions, which may have been hindered by patients’ obesity or uterine malformations. One of the patients also experienced a failed medication abortion, according to the state’s report.

Planned Parenthood sued the department last month claiming the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation. The state says Planned Parenthood has failed to comply with licensing regulations by not compelling five doctors who have worked at the clinic to be interviewed.In May, Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning the procedures after the eighth week of pregnancy.

JEFFERSON CITY — A Cole County judge on Friday sided with the Post-Dispatch in a lawsuit challenging the state’s ability to keep secret the identities of those seeking to sell medical marijuana in Missouri.Circuit Judge Daniel R. Green overruled the state’s motion to dismiss the Post-Dispatch’s lawsuit. He granted the newspaper’s motion for summary judgment to force the state to release the records.“I think that tie goes to the runner in a Sunshine Law case,” Green said on Friday.The state does not have to immediately produce the records because Green delayed the effective date of his order so the state could decide whether to appeal.
Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, which regulates medical marijuana, said Friday afternoon he had yet to meet with his legal team to decide the state’s next steps.“It’s always our intent to comply with the law,” Williams said. “The judge ruled, and unless there’s some compelling reason from the attorney general’s office or our lawyers I would think we would provide that information as quickly as we can.”
“In its oral ruling, the Court acknowledged that the case was a close one,” said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for DHSS. “The Department cannot comment on how it will proceed until a final written order is entered and reviewed.”


The Post-Dispatch sued the DHSS in January, accusing the state agency of violating the Sunshine Law by closing the applicant identifying information.The department said the text of the constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana precluded the state from releasing such information, but Joseph Martineau of Lewis Rice, an attorney for the Post-Dispatch, argued the state was relying on an “overly restrictive interpretation” of the amendment to close the records.The Missouri attorney general’s office moved to dismiss the case, while the Post-Dispatch filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking release of the records.

The amendment voters approved in November says, in part, that the department “shall maintain the confidentiality of reports or other information obtained from an applicant or licensee containing any individualized data, information, or records related to the licensee or its operation … .”“(T)he provision does not say that the Department ‘shall maintain the confidentiality of the applicant or licensee‘ as well as the reports or other information obtained from the applicant or licensee,” Martineau wrote in the Post-Dispatch’s lawsuit.

Martineau wrote the state’s interpretation “is flawed, unsupported by the language of the provision, contrary to the provision’s intent, and disregards the important public policy that the process of applying for and awarding licenses to manufacture, distribute and dispense marijuana should be open and transparent.”
State attorneys argued Green should apply a “traditional constitutional interpretation” to the constitutional clause that says the state should “maintain the confidentiality of … any information.”
“The Post-Dispatch’s position is untenable and cannot be allowed to prevail over the will of Missouri voters and the plain language of the Constitutional provision they adopted overwhelmingly,” the state said.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers, 86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.
As of late May, the state had collected $3.67 million in nonrefundable application fees from 510 pre-filed application forms, according to the state.The DHSS has said it will use a blind scoring process to assess the applications.Companies have also retained lobbyists as the application process intensifies.

For example, Steven Tilley, former Missouri House speaker and a well-known lobbyist, has signed on numerous cannabis industry clients. He also lobbies for the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association.
He was scheduled to co-host a fundraiser last month for Gov. Mike Parson, who oversees the Department of Health and Senior Services.
Because of the competition associated with the burgeoning industry, lawsuits could follow if the state rejects licenses.There has already been one dispute, between two companies seeking a state contract to help manage the state’s medical marijuana program. The state has rejected a protest by BioTrackTHC and has granted Metrc LLC the potentially lucrative contract.

ST. LOUIS — A city alderman wants to tighten the city’s curfew for children under age 17 so that they’d have to be home by 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights and by 9:30 p.m. other nights.Under the current law on the books for decades, kids have to be inside by midnight Fridays and Saturdays and 11 p.m. the rest of the week.“That’s unacceptable,” Alderman Brandon Bosley, D-3rd Ward, said in an interview after introducing his bill on Friday.“There’s no reason if you’re not an adult to be outside after hours when we’ve got all of these things going on in the city,” referring to violent crime.
Bosley acknowledged that the current law isn’t enforced much. But he said he works closely with police in his north St. Louis ward and that the curfew tightening would be an additional tool in dealing with crime.If the bill passes, he said he’d work to make sure residents in his ward get a notice regarding the changes.
The bill also would end the curfew each day at 7 a.m., an hour and a half later than the current standard.As in the current law, exemptions would be made for kids returning home from school, work, a city-sponsored activity or a religious activity.Exceptions also are provided for youths accompanied by a parent or someone over 21 years old authorized by a parent.


Also Friday, Bosley said he’d soon send a letter to Gov. Mike Parson urging him to send in the Missouri National Guard or Missouri Highway Patrol to St. Louis to help undermanned police deal with violent crime.“Things have to change or they will get worse,” Bosley said.Bosley in April first made the call for the National Guard after a man was shot after a confrontation in an alley that started when the shooter wouldn’t move his car. The victim died at a hospital.

JEFFERSON CITY — Just as Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is amassing a campaign war chest in anticipation of a run for a full term, the man he appointed attorney general also is ramping up fundraising heading toward 2020.Supporters of Republican Eric Schmitt of Glendale have raked in more than a half million dollars on his behalf, collecting cash from big money donors like retired St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield, who wrote a check for $250,000 in February.At the helm of the fundraising efforts for the pro-Schmitt political action committee known as MO Opportunity PAC is Meredith Gibbons, who formerly raised millions of dollars for disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens. Records show she is receiving $8,000 a month to fill the coffers.
The PAC snared a $100,000 check from Herzog Contracting, a St. Joseph-based construction services company run by Stanley Herzog. Herzog is a large donor to Republican causes. In 2016, for example, the company gave $650,000 to Greitens.


Other big donors include August Busch III who gave $50,000 in May.As of April 1, the PAC had $147,000. However, that doesn’t count an additional $350,000 the PAC has in a certificate of deposit that comes due in September 2019.
And, that doesn’t account for the money Schmitt has raised for his own personal campaign account. The latest reports show he has $415,000 in that account.For now, the only Democrat who has announced plans to run has just $13,930 in his campaign account.St. Louis attorney Elad Gross is a political newcomer who is hoping to return the seat to Democratic hands. Before 2017, the post had been held by Democrats dating to 1993.Schmitt was appointed attorney general after fellow Republican Josh Hawley vacated the office to join the U.S. Senate. He earned his law degree from the St. Louis University School of Law in 2000. He served two terms in the state Senate representing parts of west St. Louis County, and was a partner at the Lathrop Gage law firm until being sworn in as treasurer in 2017.

The two men serving as treasurer and deputy treasurer are Carl Struby and Jean Paul Bradshaw, both of whom are Lathrop Gage attorneys.

Attempts to discuss the fund with them were unsuccessful.The campaign fund is similar to one formed on behalf of Parson. Unlike their personal campaign accounts, which cannot receive contributions over $2,600, the separate campaign committees can take in unlimited contributions.Since Missouri voters enacted limits on campaign contributions in 2016, a growing number of candidates have set up political action committees that do not have to abide by those rules.
But unlike Greitens’ use of a nonprofit to raise money, the names of donors and the amounts they contribute are publicly disclosed.
During his 17 months in office, Greitens used the nonprofit group A New Missouri to promote his agenda.The use of the nonprofit, which also employed Gibbons, led to accusations that Greitens violated Missouri campaign finance law by intentionally concealing donors, and worries that his backers gained unfair influence within state government.

JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson appointed a former judge who has supported an anti-abortion pregnancy center — and been disciplined for publicly doing so — to an administrative panel that could handle a licensing dispute with the state’s only abortion clinic.The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 reprimanded former Macon County Associate Circuit Judge Philip Prewitt for encouraging people to donate to local charities on Facebook, including Ray of Hope Pregnancy Care Ministeries, an anti-abortion nonprofit.The Republican governor, an abortion opponent who last month signed into law one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, on June 3 appointed Prewitt to the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.
Lawyers for the state have argued that the commission should adjudicate a dispute between the state’s only clinic performing abortions and the state health department, which is refusing to renew the clinic’s abortion license. The dispute is now in St. Louis circuit court.
Prewitt has weighed in on abortion previously. He ran as a Republican for a state representative seat in 2000 and received a $250 campaign donation from Missouri Right to Life PAC. When he was serving as an associate judge in 2014, he supported Ray of Hope on his Facebook page.

“I am happy to be supporting Ray of Hope Pregnancy Center again at their fundraising dinner,” the post read. “Even if you didn’t attend, consider donating to this wonderful organization.”
Prewitt also posted about donating to a local cancer fundraiser and local schools.A state judicial oversight organization — the Missouri Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline — in 2015 found that Prewitt’s Facebook posts violated a state Supreme Court rule that bans judges from abusing the “prestige of office to advance the personal or economic interests ... of others,” including a rule that a judge may not “personally participate in the solicitation of funds or other fundraising activities.”
The commission in court filings noted that Prewitt had no prior complaints against him, was “cooperative and truthful” during the investigation, and that in response he stopped the questionable Facebook posts.
Prewitt told the Associated Press on Monday that he doesn’t see a problem with the reprimand or his past support for the pregnancy care center and from Missouri Right to Life. He said he would consider recusing himself if requested by a party in the case.“I don’t see where it would be a conflict,” Prewitt said. “It doesn’t violate the judicial rules, so I don’t see how it would violate any commissioner rules either.”

Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said the governor named Prewitt to the commission based on his experience as a judge and his past military service and that his stance on abortion was not a factor. He said the governor’s office was aware of Prewitt’s previous reprimand, but noted that the Supreme Court did not go further to suspend or revoke his license.

“Based on those qualifications, we believe that he would execute the responsibilities of commissioner appropriately,” Shippy said.Commissioners work individually, and Prewitt said cases are assigned on a rotating basis by a scheduling clerk. Three other commissioners currently serve on the panel and could also be assigned the abortion clinic case, if it ever makes it to the commission.Prewitt lost re-election in 2018 and in December resigned early. He said he applied for an open seat on the Administrative Hearing Commission several months ago and heard back around March.“Many months ago was I considered for the appointment, so this wasn’t even an issue when I was talking to the governor’s office about the appointment,” he said.
Since he left his judgeship, Prewitt has continued to be active on Facebook. In February, he posted a photo of a truck with writing on the back that says: “What’s the difference between a gun and a whiny liberal? A gun has only one trigger. #buildwall.” He’s also shared memes about vegans, atheists and a post with a photo of a woman that says, “Why is she wearing leggings?”

JEFFERSON CITY — A St. Louis judge has blocked Missouri’s Republican-led Legislature from cutting off funding to abortion providers and their affiliates.In a decision that adds another legal front to the courtroom battles already underway between a state government controlled by the GOP and affiliates of Planned Parenthood, Judge David Dowd said the attempted funding prohibition was constitutionally flawed and couldn’t be completely enforced.The ruling potentially protects health care options for an estimated 7,000 people.The case stems from a 2018 initiative by lawmakers to block Medicaid funding from going to “any abortion facility” and “any affiliate or associate thereof.”
It has become a common practice for lawmakers to use the budget to legislate policy initiatives. This year, for example, they used the maneuver to block college students with unlawful immigration status from receiving in-state tuition rates at Missouri universities.
In the case of the abortion language, Planned Parenthood sued the state saying some of its chapters provide preventive health care, but not abortion, and should not be penalized.In his decision, Dowd wrote that “eligible individuals are allowed to choose the provider they wish to see and the state is required to pay for those services on behalf of the eligible individual.”

It remains unclear whether a tweak in this year’s budget might allow the prohibition to stay intact in the new fiscal year beginning at the end of this month.
In a statement, Gov. Mike Parson suggested the ruling would be appealed.”Our office is still reviewing the court’s decision, however, we will always defend our position that no state taxpayer dollars should be used to fund abortion,” the statement noted.The ruling comes as the state and abortion rights advocates continue to fight on multiple issues.



            Planned Parenthood orderOn Thursday, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services filed a motion asking St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer to withdraw his preliminary injunction extending the license for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.
The state’s court filing also outlined results of a two-month investigation into the clinic and attached a letter highlighting “at least 30 deficient practices” the state says must be addressed before the clinic’s license can be renewed.

Planned Parenthood officials accused Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.A separate court fight is underway over attempts to put a question on the 2020 ballot asking if Missouri voters support a restrictive new law that prohibits abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy.

That issue is pending at the appeals court level.

For state legislatures around the country, the latest “Kids Count” report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation offers some important guideposts on funding priorities to ensure fewer children aren’t forced to grow up in poverty with substandard health care and education. The report has lots of good news but also points to some persistent trouble spots.For Republican-dominated states like Missouri, the report’s findings serve as a stark warning: Despite claims of being “pro-life,” lawmakers fall seriously short when it comes to ensuring a quality existence for all children beyond the womb. Forced-birth laws such as the one passed by Missouri’s Legislature last month and signed by Gov. Mike Parson have been celebrated by abortion-rights opponents as a major victory. But lawmakers continue to shortchange children in terms of their education, health care and financial security.

First some good news from the report: Nationwide, the percentage of children growing up in poverty dropped 4 percentage points between 2010 and 2017. Fewer parents lack secure employment, and fewer teens are listed as neither in school nor working. But today, more than 13 million children — about 18% of all children — still live in poverty, while more than a quarter of all parents lack secure employment.

In Missouri, 19% of kids are growing up in poverty, and 27% of parents lack secure employment. More Missouri children are growing up in single-parent households, but a smaller percentage are in families where the head of household lacks a high school diploma. Teen births also show a promising, sharp downward trend. But there’s been a sharp increase in child and teen deaths per 100,000 population.
The educational picture continues on a stubborn trajectory. Nationally and in Missouri, more than half of children ages 3 and 4 are not in school despite research pointing to improved educational outcomes when young children receive prekindergarten instruction. Missouri showed only slight improvement in the number of fourth graders not proficient in reading, dropping from 64% in 2009 to 63% in 2017.
The percentage of Missouri eighth graders not proficient in math has worsened over the past 10 years. Two-thirds now rank as nonproficient. Nevertheless, nationally as well as in Missouri, the percentage of high school students graduating on time is on a dramatic upswing.Missouri consistently ranks in the middle or among the bottom half of states in performance on overall child well-being, economic security, education and health. It shares those low rankings with Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas and Louisiana — states where the most restrictive abortion laws in the country have recently been passed.


These male-dominated legislatures claim to be fighting for children when they enact laws forcing women to give birth regardless of their emotional or financial preparedness for parenthood. But the latest Kids Count numbers expose the hypocrisy behind those “pro-life” claims.

JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri transportation officials are on track to begin replacing 40 bridges as part of a $350 million road improvement program approved by lawmakers and signed this week into law by Gov. Mike Parson.Most of the projects are small bridges in rural areas of the state.There are no bridges in St. Charles County on the list and only one is in St. Louis County. The work includes the replacement of the Ladue Road bridge that spans Hibler Creek in Creve Coeur. Work is scheduled to begin on that one later this fall.Other nearby projects include the Missouri Highway 30 bridge over Saline Creek in Jefferson County and the Highway 79 bridge over McLean’s Branch near Winfield.
Money to pay for the work is coming out of a $50 million fund set aside by lawmakers this spring as they attempted to craft a transportation improvement program without the aid of additional dollars from the state’s gasoline tax.
The motor fuel tax typically pays for roadwork. But, in 2018, voters rejected a phased-in increase of 10 cents in the state’s 17-cents-per-gallon tax on gas.


Parson, a Republican, had backed the tax hike as a way to address a growing backlog of road repairs facing the Missouri Department of Transportation.Without that additional revenue, he convinced lawmakers to allow MoDOT to sell $301 million in bonds to pay for repairs to 220 bridges across the state. But, as part of a deal with lawmakers reluctant to take out a loan for the work, the bonds will only be used if the state is awarded federal matching funds to replace the 59-year-old Interstate 70 bridge over the Missouri River near Rocheport.

MoDOT Director Patrick McKenna said he believes Missouri has a good chance of receiving the grant because of the amount of commercial truck traffic plying I-70.“It puts us in a hopeful position,” McKenna told the Post-Dispatch.The state could find out by September whether the federal dollars are coming for the estimated $350 million project.Missouri’s application calls for the state to pay $105.2 million, and Columbia and Boone County each would provide $2 million. The state also would receive a $73.1 million federal loan.“It was a very aggressive application,” McKenna said.


In January, the lack of bridges targeted for work in St. Charles County triggered outcry from the county’s two state senators, Republicans Bob Onder of Lake Saint Louis and Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring.
Eigel said he took his concerns to Parson in hopes of addressing the absence of work in one of the state’s most populous counties.In making his pitch for the brige plan, Parson said the list of projects was not politically driven, because they were chosen by regional planning boards and then approved by the state Highways and Transportation Commission.
After the first round of 40 bridges get underway, others the St. Louis region expected to be replaced include the $2.7 million replacement of a bridge over Happy Sac Creek in Franklin County and a $4.4 million replacement project at the intersection of Valley Dell Drive and Gravois Road in Jefferson County.Also on tap for work are the North Broadway bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Louis and the replacement of the Missouri Highway 47 bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Clair in Franklin County.

ST. LOUIS — State health officials asked a St. Louis judge on Thursday to reconsider his order allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open for now.The Department of Health and Senior Services filed a motion Thursday asking Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer to withdraw his preliminary injunction extending the license for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region. The state’s court filing also outlined results of a two-month investigation into the clinic and attached a letter to the clinic, highlighting “at least 30 deficient practices” the state says must be addressed before the clinic’s license can be renewed.
The deficiencies cited include inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory. The state said some problems noted in the investigation caused “serious patient harm.”
Planned Parenthood officials accused Gov. Mike Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.“We’re reviewing the state’s latest political attempt to shut down the last legal abortion provider in Missouri,” Jesse Lawder, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said in a statement Thursday. “From the start, Gov. Parson and DHSS Director Randall Williams have attempted to advance a political agenda, weaponizing the inspection process, and we have no reason to believe this is any different.”


DHSS’ court filing Thursday is the latest response in Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit aimed at keeping Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.The state’s deficiencies list included a pelvic exam that failed to detect a problem with a woman’s uterus and led to two failed abortion attempts on her. The list also included a lack of an “informed consent” consultation with a woman who later went to the emergency room over complications from an abortion.
In addition to its list of deficiencies, the state reiterated in its court brief that a state administrative commission — not a state court — is the proper place for Planned Parenthood’s license complaints. State officials asked Planned Parenthood to produce a correction plan by the end of Tuesday.
Planned Parenthood sued the department last month claiming the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation. The state has argued that Planned Parenthood failed to comply with licensing regulations by not compelling five doctors who have worked at the clinic to be interviewed as part of the state’s investigation.Stelzer ruled Monday that DHSS must decide whether to renew Planned Parenthood’s license by June 21, the date of the next court hearing over the licensing lawsuit. Stelzer did not instruct the state how to rule, but said it had the exclusive authority to decide.

Planned Parenthood’s legal fight coincides with Parson last month signing one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning the procedures after the eighth week of pregnancy.

Other lawsuitsOn Thursday, a Cole County judge tossed out one of a trio of lawsuits seeking to allow voters to decide the fate of the state’s new abortion restrictions.In dismissing the legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, Circuit Judge Daniel Green gave the organization a chance to pursue the case to a state appeals court, where the case was likely to end up anyway.The decision to dismiss the case came two days after Green set a hearing for Monday to discuss the challenge, as well as one funded by wealthy Republican campaign donor David Humphreys, who opposes the new law because it lacks protections for women who are raped or victims of incest.
Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who signs off on proposed referendums, contends the ballot initiatives cannot go forward because part of the abortion law is already in effect.

JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is taking steps to temporarily hand over power to the state’s No. 2 officeholder later this month when he travels to Europe for a trade mission and a vacation.Under a plan that is still taking shape, the Post-Dispatch has learned Parson is planning to cede his gubernatorial powers to fellow Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe during the vacation portion of his overseas trip from June 23 to July 2.The maneuver will allow Kehoe to sign legislation on Parson’s behalf, including a proposal that will transfer oversight of the Missouri Arts Council from the Department of Economic Development to the lieutenant governor’s office.
He also will have the ability to create a task force on food and beverage manufacturing in Missouri and appoint members to a Route 66 centennial commission.
As acting governor, Kehoe won’t have the ability to pardon prisoners, commute sentences or many of the other powers given to the chief executive, administration officials said.Parson intends to resume his duties when he and first lady Teresa Parson return, officials said. Details of their vacation were not immediately available.

The governor, who was appointed to the post June 1, 2018, after the resignation of scandal-plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens, is relying on a clause in the state constitution that allows the chief executive to grant his powers to the lieutenant governor.
Under that provision, he must submit a letter to legislative leaders declaring he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.Such moves are not common. But, Parson and Kehoe are from the same party and Parson appointed Kehoe to the No. 2 post after Parson took over as governor.The last time the event occurred was in 2005 when then-Gov. Matt Blunt ceded power to former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder for a short period of time.
In 2016, Kinder, a Republican, sent former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, a letter demanding Nixon grant him gubernatorial powers as Nixon was preparing to leave on an overseas trade mission.
Kinder said the state needed a chief executive in the wake of violence against law enforcement officers, including a Ballwin police officer.“I believe MO needs a leader with the authority to defend her,” Kinder said in a tweet at the time.

Nixon cancelled the trip and did not address Kinder’s request.The rules governing who’s in charge when a governor is traveling vary from state to state.For example, a provision of North Carolina’s constitution automatically elevates the lieutenant to acting governor when the full-time chief executive is absent from the state.

A similar scenario has been in California law since 1849. It says a governor must be within the state borders to have the powers of the office.Parson departs for France Saturday as part of a trade mission to Europe that includes stops in Germany and Switzerland.In what will be his first overseas trip since taking off last year, the Republican will retrace the steps taken by his predecessors during a visit to the Paris Air Show.Nixon and Blunt also attended the air show to highlight Missouri’s aerospace industry, which includes Boeing Co. and its St. Louis-made F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.Greitens was scheduled to go in 2017, but canceled after he called lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session.
The air show is set to get underway on Monday.Costs of the official portion of the trip will be shared between state taxpayers and the Hawthorn Foundation, a public/private partnership created by then-Gov. Kit Bond to help fund gubernatorial travel expenses.


Parson’s vacation will not be funded by taxpayers.
